# Magic Keys
To obtain the Magic Keys (see Magic Squares) you will need to persuade the Keeper of the Keys that you know something about the mystical nature of numbers. 

To gain that knowledge, you should consult the Number Oracle. 
On being given a series of numbers, the Number Oracle will be able to tell you if each number is abundant, deficient or perfect.
First, some definitions:
• The proper divisors of an integer are those that divide exactly into the integer, excluding the integer itself. Hence, the proper divisors of 10 are 1, 2 and 5.
• An abundant number is one in which the sum of the proper divisors is greater than the number itself. E.g. 12 is an abundant number because its proper divisors are 1,2,3,4,6 and 1+2+3+4+6 = 16, which is greater than 12. In this example we have an abundancy of 4 (i.e. 16-12).
• Similarly, a deficient number is one in which the sum of the proper divisors is smaller than the number. E.g. 10 is a deficient number because 1+2+5 = 8, giving a deficiency of 2.
• Finally, a perfect number is one in which the abundancy (or deficiency) is exactly zero, i.e. the sum of the proper divisors is equal to the number itself. 

On being supplied with a positive integer, the Oracle will tell you whether the number is abundant, deficient or perfect, together with the values of any abundancy or deficiency. Your program should continue to read numbers and pass them to the Oracle until you enter a value less than 1.
