# Spell Game
Each user is given a set of ‘spells’. 
A spell is based on one of the four elements (fire, water, earth, air), and has a ‘potency’ in the range 1-12. 
There are 48 spell cards in total, and no two cards are the same; i.e. each of the elements is associated with each of the possible potencies exactly once.

Deck is shuffled and dealt to four players and display the hands they hold.
