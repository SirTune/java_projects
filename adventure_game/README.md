# Adventure Game

Warehouse is created with randomly scatter items around the warehouse. 
Each item has a name (String), a size (int), and a value (int). 

Your hero has a backpack of capacity 50. 
You then have the following single-letter commands available to you:
 
* n, e, s, w : head north, east, south or west, assuming there is a door allowing it
* i : inventory – list all items in your backpack
* p : pick up item
* d : drop item
* m: map, if Item Detector is in inventory, item will show in map 
In the case of the ‘p’ and ‘d’ commands, the program should give you a list of items to select from.
The aim of the game is to maximise the total value of all the items in the hero’s backpack.
'ItemList.txt' can be ajusted to add or remove items
