# Magic Squares
Generate a Magic Square for when given suitable Magic Keys – a set of (distinct) integers satisfying certain properties.
Take three integers and sort them into ascending order (a, b, c) with the following conditions:
0 < a < b < (c – a) and b!=2a
If these conditions hold, the SquareMaster will conjure up (i.e. print out) a Magic Square for you:
c – b, c + (a + b), c – a
c – (a – b), c, c + (a – b)
c + a, c – (a + b), c + b

Compile and run 'MagicSquare.java'
